# ClearWave_All_in_one_AudioProcessor

##Overview: 
ClearWave is a powerful and user-friendly audio processing application that integrates recording, playback, noise cancellation, waveform visualization, and speech-to-text transcription into a single platform. Designed for both experimentation and practical use, it enables users to manipulate and interpret audio in real-time â€” ideal for educational tools, research, or accessibility applications.


## ðŸ§° Tech Stack: 
Python â€“ Core language for implementation and backend logic

NumPy & Matplotlib â€“ Used for signal processing and waveform visualization

pyaudio / sounddevice â€“ For real-time audio input/output

speech_recognition / Whisper â€“ Converts recorded audio to readable text

scipy / noisereduce â€“ Applied basic and advanced noise reduction algorithms

## ðŸ§© System Architecture 
1. Audio Input â†’ 2. Noise Reduction â†’ 3. Waveform Visualization â†’ 4. Playback â†’ 5. Transcription

Audio Input & Playback: Users can record and replay audio through their microphone using low-latency, real-time processing libraries.

Noise Reduction: Integrated filtering algorithms remove background disturbances to enhance audio clarity before transcription.

Visualization: The tool plots real-time waveforms using matplotlib, offering insight into audio amplitude and duration.

Speech-to-Text Transcription: Leveraging a speech recognition engine, it converts clean audio into readable text output for accessibility or documentation.
